2024 marks the start of my university-grade education in pursuit of an ICS major, and my current course has already provided a well-received taste of JavaScript. Before I can elaborate on what that entails, however, I would like to briefly illustrate my background by backtracking my programming journey to its beginning, and moving into a more effective comparison of the language from there.

## Now and Then with Programming

My experience in the programming world up to this point has been almost entirely in Java, with a brief side of C/C++ and some scripting languages in recent years. Yet, even prior to taking any college courses in ICS, I had ventured into programming on my own using Java, via Eclipse's Java IDE. Though Eclipse's assistive features were generally helpful to the beginner that I was, it was difficult to keep up with figuring out every little detail and rule of Java's keywords and syntax, and it would prove incredibly hard to learn the language this way.

Over the years, I continued to work in Java and tried to conjure up small personal projects. For example, there I was trying to make a game from scratch with no coding background whatsoever, and mindlessly following yesteryear's online tutorials to cobble something together. While I did see some personal breakthroughs with each new attempt at making something, they were minor achievements in retrospect and only served to shore up the insurmountable cliff-face that programming was becoming to me. Though Java was touted as a beginner-friendly language, I know now what I was feeling during those years— it was not very accessible.

## Breaking Free
Moving forward to the present, the experiences I have had now with Java; some cursory explorations in C, C++, Perl, Python and others; and my current foray into JavaScript have brought to light for me the key qualities that made my early experiences with Java so onerous, and why I have found JavaScript to be such a liberating experience by comparison.
### Java’s Pitfalls
The difficulty that I faced with Java lies in how the language is designed: development in Java requires following very strict syntax rules, and it is referred to as a “strongly typed” language. The latter indicates how Java requires explicit type declarations for everything, such as with functions or variables. A simple integer variable must be declared with an ‘int’ type and it must always be treated as an integer, lest errors are desired - and there are no shortage of exceptions to look out for as a result of Java’s rigidity. Since the explicit nature of Java’s syntax guarantees a level of readability, these qualities do provide the upside of making the code easy to decipher for beginners or peers reading one’s program, but it is at the cost of accessibility and easily leads to frustrating experiences.
### ‘Swiss-ArmyScript’

JavaScript, by comparison, alleviates many if not all grievances that may be brought on by Java’s austere structuring. This is due to the various features it...
Honestly, JavaScript is just fun to use.


## More than just appending "Script"



Overall, JavaScript's qualities make it very freeing for developers: it unshackles the restraints on flexibility imposed by other languages, making it ideal for those trying to break into the programming space, and rendering it a highly accessible language for developers of all skill levels.

*Difficulty: a thing that is hard to accomplish, deal with, or understand.*

One of my friends asked the question earlier last week -- why is it so hard to be an officer for the student branch? Why is so hard compared to working at my on-campus job? This question came after he struggled a little with bookkeeping for the student organization.

Now I gave him the standard answer - being an officer of an organization requires that you manage your time between school and work. There isn't anyone telling you what to do. It's the answer any good mentor would give, and is mostly true.

But the more I though about it, the more I wondered to myself...damn that's a really great question; it's one that deserves some more thought. Most people I think stop at the answer I gave previously - he obviously isn't managing his time properly.

Here's what I think: the difficult things will always be difficult.

## In the context of programming

In the context of programming, this has always been true. The difficult problems have always been different, although changes in technology can change the landscape quite a bit. "Business" type applications are the things that come to mind for me. Those types of applications are usually coupled in some way with people ... and people are awfully hard to deal with!

Consider that one of the most popular content management systems is also considered the most horrible - Wordpress. But really, is there anything that fills that need? If it was so easy in the first place, where is the solution? Where's the magic CMS that is designed well enough that everyone hops on the boat to use it?

Some things are just difficult - building applications that humans use is hard, and will probably be hard for at least the near future.

## In the context of engineering

Ever hear people ragging on engineering companies for delivering late and way over budget? Well, some engineering jobs are really difficult, especially if the requirements and funding are undulating underneath you. Because of the nature of the problem, sometimes engineering firms require large amounts of engineers and workers, inviting further problems and delays.

The Honolulu Rail project at home has become this sort of poster child of failure, budget overrun and overall incompetence in Hawaii. Well, working though regulatory boards and fiscal procedures in Hawaii seems like it's a mind bogglingly difficult job to do. Granted, there might be some fishy stuff going on, but I refuse to believe that everyone is involved for nefarious reasons.

The problem of creating an unprecedented public transportation backbone on an island is difficult! I'm not sure we would have done it right, even if the best people were involved.

## In the context of relationships

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
