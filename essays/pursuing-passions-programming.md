My life-long ambition has always been in the arts, with my passions stemming from my hobby in drawing and exposure to video games from an early age. Due to the latter, I have always been enamored with the concept of computer graphics, and it is that overlap between the realms of art and technology that fuels my interest in the realm of software development and engineering. The potential for software to serve as a canvas for artistic vision is what drives my current aspirations in the ICS field.
In pursuing this endeavor through university education, I hope to cultivate the skills that would allow me to create robust projects of my own, like web, desktop or mobile applications that can take advantage of my artistic creativities. Goals like developing games and graphics are what I look forward to as I proceed in learning programming.
Of course, a key objective from going through an ICS program also lies in discovering the possibilities within the scope of software engineering, which will guide trajectory in ICS as a career. Hopefully, the curriculum and practical experiences will offer me an idea on the various specializations within the field, and it may help me narrow down how to balance programming as both a career and a personal interest.
In short, my journey in software engineering is not just a pursuit of technical mastery but an exploration of the intersection between art and technology. Through the ICS program, I anticipate honing my skills in application development, gaining diverse experiences, and charting a course for a career that seamlessly merges my artistic passion with the limitless possibilities of software engineering. As I navigate this dynamic field, I am eager to contribute to the synthesis of creativity and technology, unlocking new dimensions in both art and software development.
